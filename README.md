### Day 1
#### Hash function
A math function that converts an arbitrary string or file into fixed length string(sequence of characters)
A smaller change in the input might change the output of hash function completely
The output of the hash function is completely unpredictable.
The function is irreversible i.e. the input for a given hash string cannot be produced from the output. 
The function maps the input and output in one-to-one fashion. I.e. a given output can only be reproduced by the same input.
The commonly used hash function is SHA-256
Example:
The hash function used for example is SHA-256

SHA256(“blockchain technologies”) =>  afd63d45baadf7eaf2e9b861054f7b435ae5200d46bf4e145468dc38d1e110d7

SHA256(“blockchain technologies.”) => a16478e4c8f41d65a5eed3e336b21b1685e4c9b6277897e82a67097d8762ec14

It can be seen that a smaller change in the input has changed the output completely.
